# Calculator App (no GUI)

This is a calculator project done in **Kotlin** proposed by DIO for personal practicing.

In the project, i made use of basic programming language knowledge and Kotlin syntax, which may be:

- Floating Numbers
- Null safety
- Conditional Structures (if, when)

The main point was to calculate between two pre-set numbers, and perform a randomly selected type of operation (plus, minus, times, divided by).

Thank you!
